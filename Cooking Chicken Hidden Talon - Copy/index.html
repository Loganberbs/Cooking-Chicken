      <h1>Cooking Chicken, Hidden Talon</h1>
      <i>by Logan Berberick</i>
      <p class = "intro">
         Cooking started as an optional hobby in my late teens; but a combination of financial planning, 
         healthy lifestyle and recent pandemic lockdown have turned this hobby into a necessary discipline. Instead of 
         explaining why I'm passionate about cooking a majority of my own meals, I'd rather share my recipe for taco style 
         chicken. Making you one step closer to being your own boss in terms of what your body is using as fuel.
   
         Here is a list of everything you'll use for this recipe. The yield applies to an average pack of 6 chicken 
         breasts so if you're preparing a different amount be sure to pide/multiply the ingredients accordingly.

      <i>I've always eyeballed the spices and never took the time to be precise so take these measurements with a grain of salt</i>

                     <h2>Step 1: Securing The Bag</h2>
                     <p>
                     Pour the 2 cups of citrus juice of your choice into the Ziplock® freezer bag. This will serve as the 
                     base to your marinade and helps to tenderize the chicken allowing the flavors to absorb more effectively.
                     Then add all of your dry seasonings and optional ingredients listed above into the bag, making sure everything 
                     is well incorporated.</p>
                     <p>Last but not least, add the breasts one at a time. Smooth side facing down and abrasive side up. This will 
                     allow the marinade to flow all the way to the top as apposed to forming pockets underneath the cutlets. 
                     Now that all your chicken is in the bag, we need to make sure everyone is getting an even coating of flavor. 
                     There are two ways to go about this: </p>
                     <p>One way is playing it safe and simply shaking the bag after its sealed until the 
                     contents seem completely mixed. The other option (which I highly recommend) is mixing and flipping the breasts over 
                     each other by hand. This method is the fastest and most effective however its also the messiest, so always perform this 
                     step in the sink. After properly mixing your marinade, fold the top of the bag where the chicken ends and push out as much air as possible before sealing.
                     Once sealed, place the bag in your refrigerator overnight or however long you would deem necessary.</p>
               
                     <h2>Step 2: Applying Heat</h2>
                     <img src="Postgrill.jpg" alt="grilled chicken"><img src="grillstep1.jpg" alt="raw chicken">
                     <p>
                        There are several ways to apply heat to these breasts. Using a slow cooker, grilling, pan frying or baking in 
                        the oven are all great options. Thanks to the marinade you made earlier, you really cant go wrong with whatever 
                        choice you make. However, over-cooking chicken is always a possibility and will crush your spirit after spending 
                        all that time preparing for this exact moment... Just remember that you cant un-cook anything, but you can always 
                        apply heat later. When in doubt, less is more, in terms of applying heat to meat. Internal temperature is a very 
                        accurate way to tell if meat is done cooking or not and you can read that with a meat thermometer.
                        In this case, chicken isn't safe to eat until it reaches at least 165° Fahrenheit. It also happens to be 
                        the temperature that tastes the best; so stop applying heat to the meat as soon as the internal temperature 
                        reads: 165°, no matter what method you use.

                     <ul style="list-style-type: circle"> 
                      
                        <li><h4>Slow Cooker</h4></li>
                        <img src="hank.png" alt="Hank">
                        <p>
                           Pour the contents of your bag directly into the Crock-Pot®. Setting it to "low" will take around 4 hours 
                           and setting it to "high" will take about 2 hours. Be sure to check the thickest cut with the meat thermometer until 
                           it reads above 165° Fahrenheit.
                        </p>
                    
      
                     <li><h4>Grill</h4></li>
                    
                        <p>
                           Apply Bacon Grease, Butter or Oil to your grill before starting to heat it. Whether you're using charcoal 
                           or propane (no ones judging), be sure it gets up to 450° before putting anything onto it. Place each piece 
                           onto the grill one at a time, smooth side face down and close the lid. After 7 minutes, flip each breast onto its 
                           other side and close the grill for another 6 minutes or until 165°.
                        </p>
      
                        <li><h4>Oven-Baked</h4></li>
                     <p>
                           Preheat your oven to 285°, then transfer the contents of your Ziplock® into a large Pyrex®pan. Be 
                           sure to distribute the chicken evenly so it can cook consistently. Once the oven is preheated, place the pan into 
                           the oven and set a timer for 30 minutes. Flip each cutlet after 30 minutes of baking and put it back in for another 
                           20 minutes or until 165°. <i>If you cover the top of the pan with a sheet of ReynoldsWrap®, shiny side up, 
                           you wont have to flip halfway through. Just make sure to check the internal temperature after 45 minutes to make sure it 
                           doesn't over-cook.</i>
